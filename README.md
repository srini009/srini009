- 👋 Hi, I’m Srinivasan Ramesh (@srini009)
- 👀 I’m interested in anything related to High Performance Computing (HPC)! I love designing and engineering HPC systems and software. While finding ways to put the "P" in the HPC is my daily bread-and-butter, I am equally passionate about designing tools to make HPC more accessible and user (and developer) friendly.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to do Cloud + ML + HPC
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any topic involving the development or use of performance tools for HPC, ML, and Cloud applications.
- 📫 How to reach me: srramesh@nvidia.com (Work); ramesh.srinivasan09@gmail.com (Personal)
